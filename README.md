# Kickstarter-Analysis
# MODULE 1 CHALLENGE - Kickstrting with Excel

## Project Overview
This project used date compiled from over 4000 kickstarter campaigns and multiple countries. The kickstarter campaigns represented various projects in the Arts; however, the analysis is focused specifically on theatre campaigns.


### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is two-fold. Firstly, to assist Louise in determining to what extent the launch date impacts the success, (or demise) of theatre programs. Secondly, we want to determine if the *amount* of a play's fundraising goal has any correlation with it's success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data was comiled into pivot tables and charts to assist with interpretation and visualization of the data set.

The chart below depicts the impact of launch date on the success, failure and cancellation of thetre projects:
